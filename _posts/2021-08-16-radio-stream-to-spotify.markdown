Radio stations tend to be good at collating a playlist for a specific genre or target audience. Monitoring these radio
stations creates very listenable playlists.

"Radio Stream to Spotify" was an application designed to monitor the metadata of many different radio streams, find the
currently playing song on Spotify, and then add it to a specific playlist created for that station.

The application was written in Python 3, and utilises the [Tekore](https://pypi.org/project/tekore/) library for 
interfacing with the Spotify Web API. It is able to run indefinitely, and uses little resources.

I created this mainly to fulfill a personal need - I noticed that another Spotify user ([lerman01](https://open.spotify.com/user/lerman01?si=341773f6c14744f5))
had attempted a similar idea for Virgin Radio UK, and I wanted to extend it to more radio stations.

The program ran on a Raspberry Pi, monitoring a number of different UK radio stations and adding the songs to
respective playlists.
