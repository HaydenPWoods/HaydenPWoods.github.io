A custom Bootstrap design, built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

I wanted a simple personal site that I could use to showcase projects and occasional posts. GitHub Pages fills this
remit perfectly:

* It supports Jekyll, allowing for a static site to be generated from templates and regenerated on any changes. Posts
  and pages can be added with simple Markdown files, instead of writing the entire HTML markup each time.
* It supports a nice and short custom domain.
* It's really fast and responsive - partly due to the servers being fast, but as a static site, there's no processing
  each time a page is requested.

It's my first time using the [Liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). I have been used to using
the Thymeleaf template language with Spring (Java), and there are significant differences between the two (e.g. Liquid 
uses curly brace syntax on the page, while Thymeleaf mostly uses element attributes.) Yet, it has been easy to learn 
quickly, and seems very flexible.
